     * If the value of the `grant_type` parameter contained in the token

     * a newly created access token. The extra properties specified when the

     * `AuthorizationIssueRequest::setProperties()`) will also be used, but
     * their values will be overwritten if the extra properties set by this
     * request parameter have the same keys. In other words, extra properties
     * contained in this request will be merged into existing extra properties
     * which are associated with the authorization code.
     *
     * Otherwise, if the value of the `grant_type` parameter contained in the
     * token request from the client application is `refresh_token`, properties
     * set by this request parameter will be added to the existing extra
     * properties of the corresponding access token. Extra properties having
     * the same keys will be overwritten in the same manner as the case of
     * `grant_type=authorization_code`.
     *
     * Otherwise, if the value of the `grant_type` parameter contained in the
     * token request from the client application is `client_credentials`,
     * properties set by this request parameter will be used simply as extra
     * properties of a newly created access token. Because
     * [Client Credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)
     * does not have a preceding authorization request, merging extra
     * properties will not be performed. This is different from the cases of
     * `grant_type=authorization_code` and `grant_type=refresh_token`.
     *
     * In other cases (`grant_type=password`), properties set by this request
     * parameter will not be used. When you want to associate extra properties
     * with an access token which is issued by
     * [Resource Owner Password Credentials flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3),
     * use `TokenIssueRequest::setProperties()` instead.
     *
     * Keys of extra properties will be used as labels of top-level entries in
     * a JSON response containing an access token which is returned from an
     * authorization server. An example is `example_parameter`, which you can
     * find in [5.1. Successful Response](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1)
     * of [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). The following code
     * snippet is an example to set one extra property having
     * `example_parameter` as its key and `example_value` as its value.
     *
     * ```
     * $properties = array(
     *     new Property("example_parameter", "example_value")
     * );
     *
     * $request.setProperties($properties);
     * ```
     *
     * Keys listed below should not be used and they would be ignored on
     * Authlete side even if they were used. It's because they are reserved in
     * [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and
     * [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
     *
     * + `token_type`
     * + `expires_in`
     * + `refresh_token`
     * + `scope`
     * + `error`
     * + `error_description`
     * + `error_uri`
     * + `id_token`
     *
     * Note that there is an upper limit on the total size of extra properties.
     * On the server side, the properties will be (1) converted to a
     * multidimensional string array, (2) converted to JSON, (3) encrypted by
     * AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, (4) encoded by base64url, and then stored into the
     * database. The length of the resultant string must not exceed 65,535 in
     * bytes. This is the upper limit, but we think it is big enough.
