/**
 * Response from Authlete's /api/auth/introspection API.
 *
 * Authlete's `/api/auth/introspection` API returns JSON which can be mapped
 * to this class. The resource server should retrieve the value of the
 * `action` response parameter from the response and take the following steps
 * according to the value.
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `IntrospectionAction::$INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request
 * from the resource server was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
 * In either case, from a viewpoint of the client application, it is an error
 * on the server side. Therefore, the resource server should generate a
 * response to the client application with the HTTP status of
 * `500 Internal Server Error`.
 *
 * In this case, `getResponseContent()` method returns a string which
 * describes the error in the format of
 * [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
 * Usage), so if the protected resource of the resource server wants to
 * return an error response to the client application in the way that
 * complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from `getResponseContent()`
 * method can be used as the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header. The
 * following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * WWW-Authenticate: (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 * ```
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `IntrospectionAction::$BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the
 * client application does not contain an access token (= the request from
 * the resource server to Authlete does not contain the `token` request
 * parameter).
 *
 * In this case, `getResponseContent()` method returns a string which
 * describes the error in the format of
 * [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
 * Usage), so if the protected resource of the resource server wants to
 * return an error response to the client application in the way that
 * complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from `getResponseContent()`
 * method can be used as the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header. The
 * following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * WWW-Authenticate: (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 * ```
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `IntrospectionAction::$UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does
 * not exist or has expired. Or the client application associated with the
 * access token does not exist any longer.
 *
 * In this case, `getResponseContent()` method returns a string which
 * describes the error in the format of
 * [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
 * Usage), so if the protected resource of the resource server wants to
 * return an error response to the client application in the way that
 * complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from `getResponseContent()`
 * method can be used as the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header. The
 * following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
 * WWW-Authenticate: (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 * ```
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `IntrospectionAction::$FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does
 * not cover the required scopes or that the subject associated with the
 * access token is different from the subject specified by the API call.
 *
 * In this case, `getResponseContent()` method returns a string which
 * describes the error in the format of
 * [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
 * Usage), so if the protected resource of the resource server wants to
 * return an error response to the client application in the way that
 * complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from `getResponseContent()`
 * method can be used as the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header. The
 * following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
 * WWW-Authenticate: (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 * ```
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `IntrospectionAction::$OK`, it means that the access token which the
 * client application presented is valid (= exists and has not expired).
 * The resource server is supposed to return the proteced resource to the
 * client application.
 *
 * In this case, `getResponseContent()` property returns
 * `Bearer error=\"invalid_request\""`. This is the simplest string which
 * can be used as the value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate
 * `400 Bad Request`. The resource server may use this string to tell the
 * client application that the request was bad. But in such a case, if
 * possible, the resource server should generate a more informative error
 * message to help developers of client applications. The following is an
 * example error response which complies with RFC 6750.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * WWW-Authenticate: (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 * ```
 *
 * Basically, `getResponseContent()` method returns a string which describes
 * the error in the format of
 * [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750") (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
 * Usage), so if the resource server has selected `Bearer` as the token type,
 * the string returned from `getResponseContent()` method can be used directly
 * as the value for the `WWW-Authenticate` header. However, if the service has
 * selected another different token type, the resource server has to generate
 * error message for itself.
