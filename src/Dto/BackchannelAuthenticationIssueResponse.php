/**
 * Response from Authlete's /api/backchannel/authentication/issue API.
 *
 * Authlete's `/api/backchannel/authentication/issue` API returns JSON which
 * can be mapped to this class. The authorization server implementation should
 * retrieve the value of the `action` response parameter (which can be obtained
 * by `getAction()` method of this class) from the response and take the
 * following steps according to the value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationIssueAction::$OK`, it means that Authlete has
 * succeeded in preparing JSON that contains an `auth_req_id`. The JSON should
 * be used as the response body of the response which is returned to the client
 * from the backchannel authentication endpoint. The `getResponseContent()`
 * method returns the JSON.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationIssueAction::$INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means
 * that an error occurred in Authlete.
 *
 * From a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server
 * side. Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a
 * response to the client application with `500 Internal Server Error` and
 * `application/json`.
 *
 * The `getResponseContent()` method returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationIssueAction::$INVALID_TICKET`, it means that
 * the ticket included in the API call was invalid. For example, it does not
 * exist or has expired.
 *
 * From a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server
 * side. Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a
 * response to the client application with `500 Internal Server Error` and
 * `application/json`.
 *
 * You can build an error response in the same way as shown in the description
 * for the case of `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.
