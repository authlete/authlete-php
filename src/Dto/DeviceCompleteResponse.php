/**
 * Response from Authlete's /api/device/complete API.
 *
 * Authlete's `/api/device/complete` API returns JSON which can be mapped to
 * this class. The authorization server implementation should retrieve the
 * value of the `action` response parameter (which can be obtained by
 * `getAction()` method of this class) from the response and take the following
 * steps according to the value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `DeviceCompleteAction::$SUCCESS`, it means that the API call has been
 * processed successfully. The authorization server should return a successful
 * response to the web browser the end-user is using.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `DeviceCompleteAction::$INVALID_REQUEST`, it means that the API call is
 * invalid. Probably, the authorization server implementation has some bugs.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `DeviceCompleteAction::$USER_CODE_EXPIRED`, it means that the user code
 * included in the API call has expired. The authorization server
 * implementation should tell the end-user that the user code has expired and
 * urge her to re-initiate a device flow.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `DeviceCompleteAction::$USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code
 * included in the API call does not exist. The authorization server
 * implementation should tell the end-user that the user code has been
 * invalidated and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `DeviceCompleteAction::$SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on
 * Authlete side. The authorization server implementation should tell the
 * end-user that something wrong happened and urge her to re-initiate a device
 * flow.
