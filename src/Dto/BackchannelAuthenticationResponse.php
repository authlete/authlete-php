/**
 * Response from Authlete's /api/backchannel/authentication API.
 *
 * Authlete's `/api/backchannel/authentication` API returns JSON which can be
 * mapped to this class. The authorization server implementation should
 * retrieve the value of the `action` response parameter (which can be obtained
 * by `getAction()` method) from the response and take the following steps
 * according to the value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationAction::$BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the
 * backchannel authentication request from the client application was wrong.
 *
 * The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the
 * client application with `400 Bad Request` and `application/json`.
 *
 * The `getResponseContent()` method returns a JSON string which describes the
 * error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationAction::$UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that client
 * authentication of the backchannel authentication request failed. Note that
 * client authentication is always required at the backchannel authentication
 * endpoint. This implies that public clients are not allowed to use the
 * backchannel authentication endpoint.
 *
 * The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the
 * client application with `401 Unauthorized` and `application/json`.
 *
 * The `getResponseContent()` method returns a JSON string which describes the
 * error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
 * WWW-Authenticate: (challenge)
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationAction::$INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the
 * API call from the authorization server implementation was wrong or that an
 * error occurred in Authlete.
 *
 * In either case, from a viewpoint of the client application, it is an error
 * on the server side. Therefore, the authorization server implementation
 * should generate a response to the client application with
 * `500 Internal Server Error` and `application/json`.
 *
 * The `getResponseContent()` method returns a JSON string which describes the
 * error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * (The value returned from getResponseContent())
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * When the value returned from `getAction()` method is
 * `BackchannelAuthenticationAction::$USER_IDENTIFICATION`, it means that the
 * backchannel authentication request from the client application is valid. The
 * authorization server implementation has to follow the steps below.
 *
 * + **[END-USER IDENTIFICATION]**
 *
 *     The first step is to determine the subject (= unique identifier) of the
 *     end-user from whom the client application wants to get authorization.
 *
 *     According to the CIBA specification, a backchannel authentication
 *     request contains one (and only one) of the `login_hint_token`,
 *     `id_token_hint` and `login_hint` request parameters as a hint by which
 *     the authorization server identifies the subject of an end-user.
 *
 *     The authorization server implementation can know which hint is included
 *     in the backchannel authentication request by calling the `getHintType()`
 *     method. The method returns a `UserIdentificationHintType` instance that
 *     indicates which hint is included. For example, when the method returns
 *     `UserIdentificationHintType::$LOGIN_HINT`, it means that the backchannel
 *     authentication request contains the `login_hint` request parameter as a
 *     hint.
 *
 *     The `getHint()` method returns the value of the hint. For example, when
 *     the `getHintType()` method returns `LOGIN_HINT`, the `getHint()` method
 *     returns the value of the `login_hint` request parameter.
 *
 *     It is up to the authorization server implementation how to determine the
 *     subject of the end-user from the hint. There are few things Authlete can
 *     help. Only one thing Authlete can do is to let the `getSub()` method
 *     return the value of the `sub` claim in the `id_token_hint` request
 *     parameter when the request parameter is used.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[END-USER IDENTIFICATION ERROR]**
 *
 *     There are some cases where the authorization server implementation
 *     encounters an error during the user identification process. In any error
 *     case, the authorization server implementation has to return an HTTP
 *     response with the `error` response parameter to the client application.
 *     The following is an example of such error responses.
 *
 *     ```
 *     HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 *     Content-Type: application/json
 *     Cache-Control: no-store
 *     Pragma: no-cache
 *
 *     {"error":"unknown_user_id"}
 *     ```
 *
 *     Authlete provides `/api/backchannel/authentication/fail` API that builds
 *     the response body (JSON) of an error response. However, because it is
 *     easy to build an error response manually, you may choose not to call the
 *     API. One good thing in using the API is that the API call can trigger
 *     deletion of the ticket which has been issued from Authlete's
 *     `/api/backchannel/authentication` API. If you don't call
 *     `/api/backchannel/authentication/fail` API, the ticket will continue to
 *     exist in the database until it is cleaned up by the batch program after
 *     the ticket expires.
 *
 *     Possible error cases that the authorization server implementation itself
 *     has to handle are as follows. Other error cases have already been
 *     covered by `/api/backchannel/authentication` API.
 *
 *     1. `expired_login_hint_token`:
 *         The authorization server implementation detected that the hint
 *         presented by the `login_hint_token` request parameter has expired.
 *         Note that the format of `login_hint_token` is not described in the
 *         CIBA Core spec at all and so there is no consensus on how to detect
 *         expiration of `login_hint_token`. Interpretation of
 *         `login_hint_token` is left to each authorization server
 *         implementation.
 *
 *     2. `unknown_user_id`:
 *         The authorization server implementation could not determine the
 *         subject of the end-user by the presented hint.
 *
 *     3. `unauthorized_client`:
 *         The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject
 *         backchannel authentication requests from some particular clients and
 *         found that the client which has made the backchannel authentication
 *         request is one of the particular clients.
 *         Note that `/api/backchannel/authentication` API does not return
 *         `"action":"USER_IDENTIFICATION"` in cases where the client does not
 *         exist or client authentication has failed. Therefore, the
 *         authorization server implementation will never have to use the error
 *         code `unauthorized_client` unless the server has intentionally
 *         implemented custom rules to reject backchannel authentication
 *         requests based on clients.
 *
 *     4. `missing_user_code`:
 *         The authorization server implementation has custom rules to require
 *         that a backchannel authentication request include a user code for
 *         some particular users and found that the user identified by the hint
 *         is one of the particular users.
 *         Note that `/api/backchannel/authentication` API does not return
 *         `"action":"USER_IDENTIFICATION"` when both the
 *         `backchannel_user_code_parameter_supported` metadata of the serveer
 *         and the `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client are
 *         `true` and the backchannel authentication request does not include
 *         the `user_code` request parameter. In this case,
 *         `/api/backchannel/authentication` API returns
 *         `"action":"BAD_REQUEST"` with JSON containing
 *         `"error":"missing_user_code"`. Therefore, the authorization server
 *         implementation will never have to use the error code
 *         `missing_user_code` unless the server has intentionally implemented
 *         custom rules to require a user code based on users even in the case
 *         where the `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client
 *         which has made the backchannel authentication request is `false`.
 *
 *     5. `invalid_user_code`:
 *         The authorization server implementation detected that the presented
 *         user code is invalid.
 *         Note that the format of `user_code` is not described in the CIBA
 *         Core spec at all and so there is no consensus on how to judge
 *         whether a user code is valid or not. It is up to each authorization
 *         server implementation how to handle user codes.
 *
 *     6. `invalid_binding_message`:
 *         The authorization server implementation detected that the presented
 *         binding message is invalid.
 *         Note that the format of `binding_message` is not described in the
 *         CIBA Core spec at all and so there is no consensus on how to judge
 *         whether a binding message is valid or not. It is up to each
 *         authorization server implementation how to handle binding messages.
 *
 *     7. `invalid_target`:
 *         The authorization server implementation rejects the requested target
 *         resources.
 *         The error code `invalid_target` is from RFC 8707 (Resource
 *         Indicators for OAuth 2.0). The specification defines the `resource`
 *         request parameter. By using the parameter, client applications can
 *         request target resources that should be bound to the access token
 *         being issued. If the authorization server wants to reject the
 *         request, call `/api/backchannel/authentication/fail` API with
 *         `INVALID_TARGET`.
 *         Note that RFC 8707 is supported since Authlete 2.2. Older versions
 *         don't recognize the `resource` request parameter, so
 *         `getResources()` always returns null if the Authlete server you are
 *         using is older than 2.2.
 *
 *     8. `access_denined`:
 *         The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject
 *         backchannel authentication requests without asking the end-user and
 *         respond to the client as if the end-user had rejected the request in
 *         some particular cases and found that the backchannel authentication
 *         request is one of the particular cases.
 *         The authorization server implementation will never have to use the
 *         error code `access_denied` at this timing unless the server has
 *         intentionally implemented custom rules to reject backchannel
 *         authentication requests without asking the end-user and respond to
 *         the client as if the end-user had rejected the request.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[AUTH_REQ_ID ISSUE]**
 *
 *     If the authorization server implementation has successfully determined
 *     the subject of the end-user, the next action is to return an HTTP
 *     response to the client application which contains `auth_req_id`.
 *
 *     Authlete provides `/api/backchannel/authentication/issue` API which
 *     generates a JSON containing `auth_req_id`, so, your next action is (1)
 *     call the API, (2) receive the response from the API, (3) build a
 *     response to the client application using the content of the API
 *     response, and (4) return the response to the client application. See the
 *     description `/api/backchannel/authentication/issue` API for details.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION]**
 *
 *     After sending a JSON containing `auth_req_id` back to the client
 *     application, the authorization server implementation starts to
 *     communicate with an authentication device of the end-user. It is assumed
 *     that end-user authentication is performed on the authentication device
 *     and the end-user confirms the content of the backchannel authentication
 *     request and grants authorization to the client application if everything
 *     is okay. The authorization server implementation must be able to receive
 *     the result of the end-user authentication and authorization from the
 *     authentication device.
 *
 *     How to communicate with an authentication device and achieve end-user
 *     authentication and authorization is up to each authorization server
 *     implementation, but the following request parameters of the backchannel
 *     authentication request should be taken into consideration in any
 *     implementation.
 *
 *     1. `acr_values`:
 *         A backchannel authentication request may contain an array of ACRs
 *         (Authentication Context Class References) in preference order. If
 *         multiple authentication devices are registered for the end-user,
 *         the authorization server implementation should take the ACRs into
 *         consideration when selecting the best authentication device.
 *
 *     2. `scope`:
 *         A backchannel authentication request always contains a list of
 *         scopes. At least, `openid` is included in the list (otherwise
 *         `/api/backchannel/authentication` API returns
 *         `"action":"BAD_REQUEST"`). It would be better to show the requested
 *         scopes to the end-user on the authentication device or somewhere
 *         appropriate.
 *         If the `scope` request parameter contains `address`, `email`,
 *         `phone` and/or `profile`, they are interpreted as defined in
 *         "5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values" of OpenID Connect Core
 *         1.0. That is, they are expanded into a list of claim names.
 *         The `getClaimNames()` method returns the expanded result.
 *
 *     3. `binding_message`:
 *         A backchannel authentication request may contain a binding message.
 *         It is a human readable identifier or message intended to be
 *         displayed on both the consumption device (client application) and
 *         the authentication device.
 *
 *     4. `user_code`:
 *         A backchannel authentication request may contain a user code.
 *         It is a secret code, such as password or pin, known only to the
 *         end-user but verifiable by the authorization server. The user code
 *         should be used to authorize sending a request to the authentication
 *         device.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION COMPLETION]**
 *
 *     After receiving the result of end-user authentication and authorization,
 *     the authorization server implementation must call Authlete's
 *     `/api/backchannel/authentication/complete` API to tell Authlete the
 *     result and pass necessary data so that Authlete can generate an ID
 *     token, an access token and optionally a refresh token. See the
 *     description of the API for details.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[CLIENT NOTIFICATION]**
 *
 *     When the backchannel token delivery mode is either "ping" or "push", the
 *     authorization server implementation must send a notification to the
 *     pre-registered notification endpoint of the client after the end-user
 *     authentication and authorization. In this case, the `getAction()` method
 *     `BackchannelAuthenticationCompleteResponse` (a response from
 *     `/api/backchannel/authentication/complete` API) returns `NOTIFICATION`.
 *     See the description of `/api/backchannel/authentication/complete` API
 *     for details.
 *
 * <br/>
 * + **[TOKEN REQUEST]**
 *
 *     When the backchannel token delivery mode is either "ping" or "poll", the
 *     client application will make a token request to the token endpoint to
 *     get an ID token, an access token and optionally a refresh token.
 *
 *     A token request that corresponds to a backchannel authentication request
 *     uses `urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba` as the value of the
 *     `grant_type` request parameter. Authlete's `/api/auth/token` API
 *     recognizes the grant type automatically and behaves properly, so the
 *     existing token endpoint implementation does not have to be changed to
 *     support CIBA.
 *
